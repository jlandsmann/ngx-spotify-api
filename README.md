# NgxSpotifyApi
## Introduction
This module was written to use the Spotify-Api type-save inside an angular application.
If there are issues please tell me, so I can fix them.

This module requires a proxy-server for authentication. For now [ngx-spotify-api-auth-proxy]('https://github.com/jlandsmann/ngx-spotify-api-auth-proxy) is the only supported library.
